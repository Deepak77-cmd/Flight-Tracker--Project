Detailed Explanation of Your Presentation: "Flight Tracking and Aviation Safety – The Role of Real-Time Data"
Your section focuses on how real-time flight tracking enhances aviation safety, without diving into ADS-B (covered by Aadhi) or collision avoidance systems (covered by Sunderam/Nirmal).

1. Core Concept: What is Real-Time Flight Tracking?
Definition: Flight tracking refers to the process of monitoring the position, altitude, speed, and status of an aircraft in real time.
Key Technologies Involved:
Radar (Primary/Secondary): Ground-based systems that detect aircraft via radio waves.
Satellite Tracking (e.g., Aireon): Uses space-based receivers for global coverage, including oceans.
ACARS: Transmits operational data (not real-time position tracking).

Why It Matters?
Prevents mid-air collisions.
Enables faster emergency response.
Optimizes fuel efficiency and flight paths.

2. How Real-Time Data Improves Aviation Safety
A. Collision Avoidance
How? ATC and pilots see live traffic data (e.g., via ADS-B/radar).
Example: If two planes are on a converging path, real-time alerts allow adjustments.
B. Emergency Response & Search & Rescue (SAR)
Problem: Before real-time tracking, planes like MH370 (2014) could vanish without a trace.
Solution: Now, ICAO mandates 15-minute tracking intervals (via satellites).
Tech Used: Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs) activate on impact.
C. Weather & Turbulence Avoidance
Live weather data helps pilots reroute around storms, volcanic ash, or turbulence.
Example: Delta Air Lines uses real-time weather analytics to reduce turbulence injuries.
D. Predictive Maintenance
Sensors transmit engine/aircraft health data mid-flight.
For example, Rolls-Royce monitors jet engines in real time to prevent failures.

3. Challenges in Real-Time Flight Tracking
A. Coverage Gaps
Radar doesn’t work over oceans → Relies on satellites (still some latency).
Solution: Space-based ADS-B (e.g., Aireon).
B. Cybersecurity Risks
ADS-B signals are unencrypted → Vulnerable to spoofing/hacking.
Solution: Blockchain/AI-based verification in development.
C. Cost & Adoption
Retrofitting older planes with tracking tech is expensive.
Smaller airlines may lag behind.

4. The Future of Real-Time Flight Tracking
A. Space-Based Global Coverage
Companies like Aireon (Iridium NEXT satellites) now provide real-time tracking worldwide, even over oceans.
B. AI & Machine Learning
Predicts maintenance issues before they happen.
Analyzes flight patterns for risk detection.
C. Blockchain for Secure Data
It could prevent ADS-B spoofing by encrypting flight data.

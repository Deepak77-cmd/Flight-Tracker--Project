"Flight Tracking and Aviation Safety â€“ The Role of Real-Time Data"
- The aviation industry relies heavily on real-time data to ensure the safety and efficiency of flights. Flight tracking technologies, powered by live 
data streams,allow airlines, air traffic controllers, and safety agencies to monitor aircraft positions, weather conditions, and system performance in 
real time. This continuous flow of information enhances situational awareness, supports quick decision-making, and plays a critical role in preventing accidents.
As technology advances, real-time flight tracking has become a vital tool for improving aviation safety standards worldwide.
